Light-weight java profiler from google, see http://jeremymanson.blogspot.com/2013/07/lightweight-asynchronous-sampling.html
The call stack generated is later used to generate a FlameGraph, see https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph

Usage: 
1. startEnv.sh -agentpath:/tmp/liblagent.so=file=traces.txt
2. trace file is generated during vm shutdown
3. use script/graph.sh generate svg file
4. incremental dump is enabled by setting -agentpath:/tmp/liblagent.so=file=traces.txt,interval=60

TODO:
1. add native stack
